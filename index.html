            <p class="subheading-p1">If anyone wants to enrich his multi cultural knowledge then in my opinion he should
                be engaged with
                global community. Now there are various kinds of social media have been launched. Through these social
                media easily we can interact with whole world. Moreover its really easy to find the people wha have
                similar interest like us. So through this media easily we can share our opinion and exchange
                information.</p>

            <p>In our country there are many blood bank but the probelm is most of them are manual and so slow.if anyone
                fall in critical situation then it becomes very difficult to manage blood for the patient. So my plan is
                to build a digital blood bank management sytem where all the data will be up to date and i wanna use
                diffrent type of AI to sereve people more quickly.Registered member will get the update of the portal in
                daily basis.</p>
